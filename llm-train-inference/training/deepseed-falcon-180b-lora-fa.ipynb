    "# Fine-tune Falcon 180B with DeepSpeed ZeRO, LoRA & Flash Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Falcon 180B is the newest version of Falcon LLM family. It is the biggest open source model with 180B parameter and trained on more data - 3.5T tokens with context length window upto 4K tokens. In this example we will show how to fine-tune Falcon 180B using DeepSpeed, Hugging Face Transformers, LoRA with Flash Attention on a multi-GPU machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "In detail you will learn how to:\n",
    "1. Setup Development Environment\n",
    "2. Load and prepare the dataset\n",
    "3. Fine-Tune Falcon 180B using DeepSpeed, Hugging Face Transformers, LoRA with Flash Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the code lets take a quick look on the technologies and methods we are going to use: \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is DeepSpeed ZeRO?\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepSpeed ZeRO focuses on efficient large-scale training of Transformers. ZeRO, or Zero Redundancy Optimizer, reduces memory footprint by partitioning model states across devices instead of basic data parallelism. This saves significant memory - ZeRO-Infinity can reduce usage 100x vs data parallelism. ZeRO-Offload further reduces memory by offloading parts of model and optimizer to CPU, enabling 10B+ parameter models on 1 GPU. ZeRO [integrates with HuggingFace Transformers through a configuration file](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.26.1/en/main_classes/deepspeed).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is LoRA?\n",
    "\n",
    "[LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) enables efficient fine-tuning of large language models. It decomposes weight matrices into smaller, trainable update matrices that adapt while keeping original weights frozen. This drastically reduces trainable parameters for faster, lower-memory tuning. LoRA integrates into [Transformers via Hugging Face's PEFT](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/conceptual_guides/lora). It combines well with methods like DeepSpeed. Key advantages are efficient tuning, portable models, and no inference latency when merging trained weights. LoRA allows adaptively training massive models with limited resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Flash Attention?\n",
    "\n",
    "Flash Attention is an algorithm that speeds up the core attention mechanism in Transformer language models by restructuring computations. It uses techniques like tiling and recomputation to reduce the high memory costs of attention, enabling models to process longer text sequences. Flash Attention 2 optimizes parallelism and work partitioning for 2x speedup over the previous version, reaching 230 TFLOPS/s on A100 GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access Falcon 180B \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can start training we have to make sure that we accepted the license [tiiuae/falcon-180B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-180B) to be able to use it. You can accept the license by clicking on the Agree and access repository button on the model page at: \n",

    "DeepSpeed ZeRO is natively integrated into the [Hugging Face Transformers Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.33.1/en/main_classes/deepspeed).
