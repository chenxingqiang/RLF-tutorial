    "# Fine-tune classifier with ModernBERT in 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in 2024. However, smaller, specialized models - particularly for classification tasks - remain critical for building efficient and cost-effective AI systems. One key use case is routing user prompts to the most appropriate LLM or selecting optimal few-shot examples, where fast, accurate classification is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post demonstrates how to fine-tune ModernBERT, a new state-of-the-art encoder model, for classifying user prompts to implement an intelligent LLM router. ModernBERT is a refreshed version of BERT models, with 8192 token context length, significantly better downstream performance, and much faster processing speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to:\n",
    "1. Setup environment and install libraries\n",
    "2. Load and prepare the classification dataset  \n",
    "3. Fine-tune & evaluate ModernBERT with the Hugging Face `Trainer`\n",
    "4. Run inference & test model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick intro: ModernBERT\n",
    "\n",
    "ModernBERT is a modernization of BERT maintaining full backward compatibility while delivering dramatic improvements through architectural innovations like rotary positional embeddings (RoPE), alternating attention patterns, and hardware-optimized design. The model comes in two sizes:\n",
    "- ModernBERT Base (139M parameters)\n",
    "- ModernBERT Large (395M parameters)\n",
    "\n",
    "ModernBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across classification, retrieval and code understanding tasks while being 2-4x faster than previous encoder models. This makes it ideal for high-throughput production applications like LLM routing, where both accuracy and latency are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "ModernBERT was trained on 2 trillion tokens of diverse data including web documents, code, and scientific articles - making it much more robust than traditional BERT models trained primarily on Wikipedia. This broader knowledge helps it better understand the nuances of user prompts across different domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more about ModernBERT's architecture and training process, check out the official [blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/modernbert). \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we learned how to fine-tune ModernBERT for an LLM routing classification task. We demonstrated how to leverage the Hugging Face ecosystem to efficiently train and deploy a specialized classifier that can intelligently route user prompts to the most appropriate LLM model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using modern training optimizations like flash attention, fused optimizers and mixed precision, we were able to train our model efficiently. Comparing ModernBERT with the original BERT we reduced training time by approximately 3x (1048s vs 321s) on our dataset and outperformed the original BERT by 3% on a more challenging dataset. But more importantly, ModernBERT was trained on 2 trillion tokens, which are more diverse and up to date than the Wikipedia-based training data of the original BERT.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example showcases how smaller, specialized models remain valuable in the age of large language models - particularly for high-throughput, latency-sensitive tasks like LLM routing. By using ModernBERT's improved architecture and broader training data, we can build more robust and efficient classification systems."
